This is a library for implementation of the circular buffer.
Circular_buffer.h is the header which contains function prototypes of all features implemented.
These are the operations that have been implemented: Allocate dynamic memory for given number of data items, add data item, remove a data item, destroy the circular buffer, dump all the data contents and return size of the circular buffer.
Circular_buffer.c is the source file having definitions for all the above features.
main.c is the main that needs to be executed and it gives an idea on how to implement function calls for this created library.
I used gcc compiler for my compilation.

Sample run: gcc -o main Circular_buffer.c main.c
