The code in profiling.c essentially measures the time it takes to create a process using fork+exec and a thread created using pthread_create.

Instructions to run:
1> To run for the fork_exec, use the macro FORK_EXECV_PROCESS.
   $gcc child.c -o child
   $gcc profiling.c -o profiling
   $./profiling

2> To run for the pthread_create, use the macro PTHREAD_CREATE.
   $gcc profiling.c -pthread -o profiling
   $./profiling

3> Compare their execution times.

The code in kernel_profiling.c measures the time it takes to create a kernel thread by making use of the do_gettimeofday method in kernel space.
This code is implemented as a kernel module. 
Steps to execute:
1> $make
2> $sudo insmod kernel_profiling.ko
3> $sudo rmmod kernel_profiling
4> dmesg
