This is a library for implementation of the doubly linked list.
doubly_linked_list.h is the header which contains function prototypes of all features implemented.
These are the operations that have been implemented: Add a node, remove a node, destroy the linked list, print all nodes, search for a particular data item, return size of the linked list.
doubly_linked_list.c is the source file having definitions for all the above features.
main.c is the main that needs to be executed and it gives an idea on how to implement function calls for this created library.
I used gcc compiler for my compilation.

Sample run: gcc -o main doubly_linked_list.c main.c
